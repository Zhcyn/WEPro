This is an impetuous world, but it is full of tranquility.

Light, slow and casual. These are the three themes I want to stick to in the new essay:

Light-on the way home, your footprints remain on the snow, I tried to gently step on my feet.

Slow-the days of the past have become slow, cars, horses, and mail are all slow, and only enough to love one person in a lifetime.

Withâ€”time is like a shuttle, light and shadow are like yesterday, we must have an epiphany and not obsessed, calm and not lost, let bitterness and happiness follow the wind, not hate nor resentment, spring will continue to warm, flowers continue to bloom, stay in the moment, and follow the situation.

The future is far away. May we move forward together on the path of our dreams. May time not grow old and we will not leave.
